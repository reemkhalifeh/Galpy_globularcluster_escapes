# Orbital Properties of Stars that have Escaped the Cores of Galactic Globular Clusters
Globular clusters undergo the process of dissolution for multiple reasons. An example of this
phenomenon is stars escaping their cores to then populate the halo or disc of the Milky Way
(Loyola & Hurley 2013). Globular clusters tend to host really dense cores that result in close
energetic encounters between stars leading to an escape from the core. We will be measuring
the orbital properties of the simulated stars escaping the 150 Galactic globular cluster cores
and taking Omega Centauri as a case study. A number of simulations of the same escaping
star are created by providing different combinations of velocities and directions to mimic the
process if it was to occur billions of years ago. Through computing actions & then mean
absolute deviation values to represent the simulations of the star, we are able to identify the
range of actions an it might fall under and to which parent cluster it belongs. When simulating
stellar systems of this kind, one must take into account the different variables impacting the
trajectories constructed including; the time of escape in Gyr and the significance of the cluster’s
gravitational potential. According to our models, a cluster’s potential is negligible as it does
not produce action values that deviate from those when ignoring its influence. On the other
hand, the escape times, ranging from 0.5 Gyr to 5 Gyr, could result in highly diverse action
variables Jr, Lz, and Jz, as it represents an escape at different moments of a cluster’s orbit. Our
data suggests that the percentage of globular clusters with a ratio of mean absolute deviations
Jr of their escapees to their own Jr values of up to 0.01 is 10.4%. This indicates that if a star
were to escape those globular clusters, it would be easier to locate in the future meaning that
its orbit is more dynamically associated with its parent cluster. Gaia EDR3 catalog is used in
this study to test the correlation of observed stars occupying the same positions in space as our
simulated stellar positions. This allows us to locate candidate stars in several globular clusters
with Omega Cen being the main focus. While this narrows down the possible escapees from
halo stars, distances, chemical abundances and full radial velocities are required for future
research to provide more accurate results.
